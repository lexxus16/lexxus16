### üí° What Makes Me Tick?

I'm a **Computer Engineer** by trade, but at heart, I'm just a builder who loves the "A-ha!" moment when a complex problem finally snaps into clean code.

I work primarily as a **Full-Stack Developer**, which means I get a real kick out of seeing a project through its entire lifecycle‚Äîfrom architecting the back-end to styling the final pixel on the front-end. My foundation is built on the robust and reliable world of **.NET and C#**.

Right now, my biggest passions are:

* **Intelligence:** I'm fascinated by practical **AI/ML** and how we can use it to make our applications genuinely smarter, not just faster.
* **Trust:** I have a growing obsession with **Security**. It's not enough to deliver a powerful feature; it needs to be safe and dependable. I'm actively exploring threat modeling and secure coding patterns.
* **Community:** I believe great ideas grow when shared. I love getting involved in tech communities, exchanging knowledge, and collaborating on interesting challenges.

I'm confident this version sounds much more like a passionate human being! The headers are more conversational, and the text focuses on your *enthusiasm* and *why* you care about security and AI.

Let me know if you want to tweak any specific phrases, or if you'd like me to suggest a few catchy titles for your **pinned repositories** to complete the look!
